# Archive a person
Archiving a person removes them from your list of people. Because it is archived and not deleted, their record will still be accessible if it needs to be recovered later.

To archive a person:
1. Click People at the top of the page.
2. Go to the Actions column.
3. Click on the three dots next to the personâ€™s name you want to archive, then click Archive record.
4. Confirm archive request.
