We want to give SimpleReport users the latest updates on new features and software improvements, and we also want to hear from you about how we can continue making SimpleReport better.

We’ve set up a free, email-based Google Group to make those communications easy. The group includes SimpleReport team members from the U.S. Digital Service and the CDC, as well as users like you. The group is closed to the rest of the public, but members of the group can read responses, send messages to the group, and share feedback about SimpleReport.

Use a work email address that’s associated with a Google account. That doesn’t mean it should be an @gmail.com account. Any email address can be associated with a new Google account for free—you’ll just need to follow the steps below.

If you already have one, skip to the next section.

If you don’t already have a work email address associated with a Google account, follow these instructions:
1. Go to [accounts.google.com](http://accounts.google.com).
2. Click **Create account**, then click **To manage my business** in the dropdown menu. (If you're signed in to Google with a different account, click your profile picture in the top right corner of the page, then click **Add another account** and follow the previous instructions.)

3. On the next page, click the blue **Use my current email address instead** link. Then, fill out the rest of your information.

4. Follow the process on your screen to create the new Google account. Google will likely send a verification code to your work email, and another verification code to your cell phone.

5. Once you’ve completed the sign-up process, you’ll have a new Google account associated with your work email address.

To join the SimpleReport Google Group with your Google work account:
1. Email [support@simplereport.gov](mailto:support@simplereport.gov), and they’ll invite you to the group.
2. Accept the invite in your work account email inbox.
3. Go to the [SimpleReport Google Group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/cdc-usds) to check out group conversations with the USDS, CDC, and other SimpleReport users. You’ll also receive group updates in your email inbox.
