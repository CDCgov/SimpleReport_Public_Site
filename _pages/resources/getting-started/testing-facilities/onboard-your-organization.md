Welcome to SimpleReport! Let’s get started.

We’ll start with these steps:
- Watch the SimpleReport onboarding video
- Request access for your testing facility

## Watch the SimpleReport onboarding video
Get started with a video introduction to SimpleReport.

<div class="usa-embed-container">
  <iframe title="PRIME SimpleReport Introduction & Onboarding Guide" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YsfDprX2aw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Request access for your testing facility
To get access, fill out the [SimpleReport facility access request form](https://airtable.com/shrP44AsyW1CYy05V). If you have multiple facilities, fill out the form separately for each facility. (If you have three facilities, you’ll fill out the form three times.)

Make sure that the facility name that you enter in the form is accurate, since this is the name that SimpleReport will share with your public health department.

Within a few days of completing the form, DocuSign will email you a document to review and sign. Once you’ve signed, we’ll schedule a video call to wrap up a few final pieces and get your facility access to SimpleReport.
