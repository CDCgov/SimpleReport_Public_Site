Welcome to SimpleReport! Let’s get started.
{: .usa-intro .margin-top-1}

## Onboarding checklist
Complete the following steps to start using SimpleReport:
- Request access for your testing facility
- Complete DocuSign documents
- Verify your identity
- (optional) Get training
- Start testing

## Request access for your testing facility
To get access, fill out the [SimpleReport facility access request form](https://airtable.com/shrP44AsyW1CYy05V). If you have multiple facilities, fill out the form separately for each facility. (For example, if you have three facilities, you’ll fill out the form three separate times.)

Make sure that the facility name that you enter in the form is accurate, since this is the name that SimpleReport will share with your public health department.

## Complete DocuSign documents
Within a few days of completing the form, DocuSign will email you a document to review and sign. If you don’t get the document, check your spam folder for an email with the subject line “Access Request for SimpleReport”. If you still can’t find the email, [contact us for help]({% link _pages/resources/troubleshooting/contact-us-for-more-help.md %}).

## Verify your identity
Once you’ve completed the DocuSign documents, we’ll schedule a video call to wrap up a few final pieces and get your facility access to SimpleReport.

You’ll receive an email with the subject line “SimpleReport access”, sent from one of our HHS team members. The email will let you schedule a 15-minute video call, during which you’ll be asked to show a government-issued ID and a work ID.

## (optional) Get training
