To get started, we need to confirm some information about your organization and set your team up with SimpleReport accounts.

## Set up your facilities
To get an account, fill out the [SimpleReport account request form](). Fill out the form for each individual site where you’ll conduct tests.

Make sure that the facility names you enter in the form are accurate, since they’re the names that SimpleReport will share with your public health department.

For each site, you’ll have the option to do a one-time bulk upload of people who regularly get tested there. For example, you might repeatedly test staff members, a group of students, or nursing home residents. You can provide a spreadsheet of those people during the onboarding process, and we’ll pre-load them into your SimpleReport account.

To make these uploads easy, use our [CSV template](). You can always add new users one-at-a-time after you’re done onboarding.

## Get access for your staff
Everyone at your site who’ll use SimpleReport will need to have their own account. Accounts are hosted by Okta, in partnership with the Department of Health & Human Services.

Identify all of the people who’ll need accounts, and have them complete the [SimpleReport staff access form](). (You can also fill out the form for them.)

Before scheduling a training session, make sure that all staff members have received their Okta accounts and are able to log in to SimpleReport. Staff members can also [reset their passwords]() if necessary.

For more on setting up an account, go to [Register for an account]().

Staff members also must [join the USDS-CDC Google Group](), which provides updates on SimpleReport.

If you run into any other problems, contact [USDS@cdc.gov]().

## Continue onboarding
Take the next steps in your onboarding by following the onboarding checklist.
