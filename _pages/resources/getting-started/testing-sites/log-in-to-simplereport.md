Once you’ve activated your account, you can log in and start using SimpleReport.

To log in:
1. Go to SimpleReport.gov and click **Log in** at the top right corner of the page.
![alt_text]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/step-1.png %})
2. Enter your username and password.
3. You’ll need to use the multifactor authentication option that you set up when you registered your account. Here’s an example of what you’ll need to do if you set up SMS authentication:
   - Click the gray **Send code** button to have the verification code sent to your phone. (Make sure to click the button, or else the code won’t get sent.)
   ![alt_text]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/sms-step-1.png %}){: .maxw-card-lg }
   - Once you receive the text, enter the code in the “Enter Code” field.
   ![alt_text]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/sms-step-1.png %}){: .maxw-card-lg }
   - Click **Verify**.
4. If your organization has multiple testing facilities, select yours from the choices shown.

Once you’ve successfully logged in, you can do a number of tasks, like [conduct a test]({% link _pages/resources/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests.md %}) or [add a new person to SimpleReport]({% link _pages/resources/using-simplereport/manage-people-you-test/add-a-new-person.md %}).
