SimpleReport uses a service called Okta to register users and create their accounts. Look for an email invitation from Okta to activate your user account.

Once you’ve set up your account, you can [invite members of your team to SimpleReport]({% link _pages/resources/using-simplereport/manage-users/invite-new-users.md %}).

Once you receive the invitation, follow these steps:
1. Click the green **Activate your SimpleReport account** button. You’ll need to click the button within 7 days of receiving the invitation, or else it will expire.

2. On the page that appears, you’ll need to pick:
  - A secure password
  - A forgot password question
  - A security image
  These all help to keep your account secure.

1. Click **Create My Account** at the bottom right of the page.

4. [Pick a multifactor authentication option](#multifactor-authentication-options), and click **Setup** below it. These authentication options, too, are meant to secure your account. For most users, SMS authentication is the easiest option, because it sends a text message to your phone.
  - At the bottom of this page, you can review instructions for setting up [SMS authentication and Google Authenticator/Okta Verify](#multifactor-authentication-options).

5. Click the **Finish** button at the bottom of the registration page. The page will confirm that you’ve successfully set up your multifactor authentication, and you’ll get a confirmation email, too.

Now that you’re registered, [join the USDS-CDC Google Group]({% link _pages/resources/staying-connected/join-the-simplereport-google-group.md %}), which provides updates on SimpleReport.

You can now [log in to SimpleReport]({% link _pages/resources/getting-started/testing-sites/log-in-to-simplereport.md %}).

### If you choose Google Authenticator or Okta Verify
1. Select the kind of phone that you use (either iPhone or Android). You’ll be asked to download an app. Download it on your phone and wait for it to install. (The page on your device might vary a bit from the screenshot below, based on your device type and whether you chose Google Authenticator or Okta Verify.)

4. Back on your phone, the app will show you a code. Enter the code on the registration page, then click **Verify**. (The code changes regularly, so you’ll need to check the app each time you log in to SimpleReport.)
