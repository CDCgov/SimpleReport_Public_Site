Public health departments receive SimpleReport testing data via PRIME ReportStream. ReportStream is a free and open-sourced data platform that makes it easier for testing facilities to send their COVID-19 rapid test data to public health departments.

There are three main reasons for public health departments to use ReportStream:
- **You’ll receive data from SimpleReport.** If your jurisdiction wants to receive point-of-care tests results from SimpleReport, you’ll need to build an integration with ReportStream.
- **You’ll have to support fewer connections.** ReportStream’s model focuses on aggregating data from multiple sources and senders, which you’ll receive together in a single feed.
- **You’ll get more complete, timely data.** ReportStream validates data from its senders and transfers it to you at your preferred frequency and in your preferred format.

To let testing facilities in your jurisdiction send you data through SimpleReport, you need to connect to ReportStream. Here’s a guide to walk you through the process:
