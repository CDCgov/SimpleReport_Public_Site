You can add a testing facility directly in SimpleReport. Before you add a new facility, make sure that it’s in [a jurisdiction that SimpleReport supports]({% link _pages/resources/using-simplereport/manage-facility-info/find-supported-jurisdictions.md %}).

To add a testing facility:
1. Click the gear icon at the top right corner of the page. (If the gear doesn’t appear in your account, you’ll need to have an administrator [change your account permissions]({% link _pages/resources/using-simplereport/manage-users/manage-user-permissions.md %}) before you can add a facility.)
2. Beneath the SimpleReport logo at the top of the page, find the “Manage Organization” and “Manage Facilities” tabs. (Your organization is the umbrella for all of your facilities.) Click **Manage Facilities**.
3. Click **+ New facility**.
4. Enter information for the new facility.
5. When you’re done, scroll back to the top right of the page and click **Save changes**.
