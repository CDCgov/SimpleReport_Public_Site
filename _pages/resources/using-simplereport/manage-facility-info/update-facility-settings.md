You may need to change information about your facility, from the phone number to the ordering provider to the testing devices you use. Although this is possible, be careful: editing your information can cause problems with reporting to public health departments.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--warning">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <p class="usa-alert__text">Only change facility information if doing so is absolutely necessary. To change the name of your facility, contact <a href="mailto:support@simplereport.gov">support@simplereport.gov</a> to make sure that your results continue sending to your public health department.</p>
