After you’ve added someone in SimpleReport, you may need to return and update their information. There might be a mistake in their information, or they might simply have changed their phone number.

To update someone's profile:

1. Click **People** at the top of the page.
2. Click on the name of the person whose profile you want to update.
3. A page with all of the person’s information will appear. Add or edit whichever information you need to update.
4. Click the blue **Save changes** button at either the top right or bottom left of the page. (The button will be gray until you’ve made a change.)

You’ll be sent back to the “People” page, and a green box will appear at the bottom of the page to confirm that SimpleReport has saved your update. You’re all done.
