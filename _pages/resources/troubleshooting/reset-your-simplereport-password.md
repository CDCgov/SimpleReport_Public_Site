To reset your password online, go to [hhs-prime.okta.com/signin/forgot-password](https://hhs-prime.okta.com/signin/forgot-password) and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can follow these steps:

2. Click **Log in** at the top right of the page.
3. Click **Need help signing** in? at the bottom of the page.
4. Click **Forgot password**.
5. Enter your email address, then click the blue **Reset via Email** button.
6. Check your email inbox. You should receive an email allowing you to reset your password. Open the email and click the link inside.
7. Answer your security question.
8. Enter a new password.
9. You’ll need to use the multifactor authentication option that you set up when you registered your account. Here’s an example of what you’ll need to do if you set up SMS authentication:
   - Click the gray **Send code** button to have the verification code sent to your phone. (Make sure to click the button, or else the code won’t get sent.)
   - Once you receive the text, enter the code in the “Enter Code” field.
   - Click **Verify**.
