SimpleReport is a free tool that helps COVID-19 testing sites report rapid test results. Developed by the CDC in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service, SimpleReport makes it easy to record and report your tests.

With real-time reporting and automatic formatting to match your public health department’s requirements, SimpleReport can help save your team time and increase the accuracy of your data.

SimpleReport is currently available in Arizona and Florida, with more locations coming soon.
